## TESTING

We recommend testing WHAT IS DEEP DREAM in a MAMP / WAMP local server environment. Simply clone the repo into MAMPs root folder (usually htdocs on MacOS, www on Windows). Then navigate to localhost:8888/rogers_brendan_HW3. This allows the AJAX code to execute properly.

## SPECIAL THANKS
